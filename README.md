100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp
Welcome to my personal journey through The 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2025 by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. This repository serves as a dedicated space to document, organize, and share all the code, projects, and challenges completed as I work my way through this comprehensive Python programming course.

üéØ Goal
The primary goal of this repository is to track my daily progress, solidify my understanding of Python concepts, and build a robust portfolio of practical programming projects.

üìö Course Structure & Progress
The course is structured to cover a vast range of topics, from fundamental Python syntax to advanced concepts and practical application development.

‚ú® Key Topics Covered (and to be Covered):
Fundamentals: Variables, data types, control flow (if/else), loops (for, while), functions, and scope.

Data Structures: Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes, objects, inheritance, and the role of self.

Module Usage: Working with popular Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Requests).

Web Development/Automation: Web scraping, building simple websites with frameworks like Flask or Django, and using tools like Selenium.

GUI Development: Creating desktop applications with libraries like Tkinter.

Data Science & Machine Learning: Introduction to data manipulation and basic ML concepts.

üìÅ Repository Structure
Each day's work is organized into a separate folder, making it easy to navigate and review specific concepts or projects:

Folder Name Example	Description	Status
Day 01 - Band Name Generator	Introductions, printing, variables, and input.	‚úÖ Completed
Day 05 - Password Generator	Python Lists, Loops, and range().	‚è≥ In Progress
Day XX - Project Title	Brief description of the main project.	üí° Upcoming
