## 100 Days of Code: Python Pro Bootcamp

Welcome to my personal journey through **The 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2025** by **Dr. Angela Yu** on **Udemy**. This repository serves as a dedicated space to document, organize, and share all the code, projects, and challenges completed as I work my way through this comprehensive Python programming course.

---

## üéØ Goal

The primary goal of this repository is to track my daily progress, solidify my understanding of **Python** concepts, and build a robust portfolio of practical programming projects.

---

## üìö Course Structure & Progress

The course is structured to cover a vast range of topics, from fundamental Python syntax to advanced concepts and practical application development.

### ‚ú® Key Topics Covered (and to be Covered):

* **Fundamentals:** Variables, data types, control flow (`if/else`), loops (`for`, `while`), functions, and scope.
* **Data Structures:** Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Classes, objects, inheritance, and the role of `self`.
* **Module Usage:** Working with popular Python libraries (e.g., `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Requests`).
* **Web Development/Automation:** Web scraping, building simple websites with frameworks like **Flask** or **Django**, and using tools like **Selenium**.
* **GUI Development:** Creating desktop applications with libraries like **Tkinter**.
* **Data Science & Machine Learning:** Introduction to data manipulation and basic ML concepts.

### üìÅ Repository Structure

Each day's work is organized into a separate folder, making it easy to navigate and review specific concepts or projects:

| Folder Name | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Day 01 - Band Name Generator` | Introductions, printing, variables, and input. | ‚úÖ **Completed** |
| `Day 02 - BMI Calculator` | Primitive Data types, Type Conversion and Number Manipulation. | ‚úÖ **Completed** |
| `Day XX - Project Title` | *Brief description of the main project.* | ‚è≥ **In Progress** |

    ```
2.  **Navigate to a specific day's folder (replace `XX - Project Title`):**
    ```bash
    cd Python-Bootcamp/Day XX - Project Title
    ```
3.  **Run the Python script (replace `your_script_name.py`):**
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
